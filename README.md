# Project 2 - Race Performance
---

### Topic

+ Factors affecting high school cross country race performance
	-Location (elevation), course (difficulty), heat of location, allergens, goal setting, aggressiveness of goals, home school size, home school location

+ It is interesting to see what factors affect a great race beyond what the racer can control (training, goal setting)

### Datasets

+ Two .csv files provided by XC Stats (www.xcstats.com)
	-577,000 rows of individual race performance statistics since 2011 including a racer id, racer school, racer gender, course id, course distance, previous course time, best course time, if a goal was set/met.
	-1,900,000 rows of individual training logs including a racer id, date of training, effort value, and feel value.

+ Possibly add the following data from outside sources
	-lat/lon of race locations
	-average temperatures (either for cross country season or temperature on race day)
	-allergens in area (average or race day)

### Visualizations

+ Bar chart (male and female) winning racer time (y) over years (x)
	-All courses and/or specific courses

+ Heatmap or scattergram on a California map of 
	-where PRs (personal records) are achieved
	-temperature
	-allergens (maybe)

+ Additional visualizations of factors outside a racer's control

	-show school size and PRs or top ten finishes
	-show how average temperature (during cross country season) or elevation of home school location (training ground) affects # of top ten finishes

+Visualizations of factors within a racer's control
	-show how goal setting affects a PR
	-show agressiveness of goal affects a PR
	-show how the porportion of high-effort training days two weeks (consult a coach for predicted ideal time) before a race affects a PR
